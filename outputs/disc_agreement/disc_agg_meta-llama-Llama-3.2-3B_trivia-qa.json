Webopedia Definition [PAR] email fax [PAR] Spam is considered to be electronic junk mail or junk newsgroup postings. Some people define spam even more generally as any unsolicited email . However, if a long-lost brother finds your email address and sends you a message, this could hardly be called spam, even though it is unsolicited. Real spam is generally email advertising for some product sent to a mailing list or newsgroup . [PAR] Why is it Called Spam? [PAR] There is some debate about the source of the term, but the generally accepted version is that it comes from the Monty Python song, \"Spam spam spam spam, spam spam spam spam, lovely spam, wonderful spam\". Like the song, spam is an endless repetition of worthless text. Another school of thought maintains that it comes from the computer group lab at the University of Southern California who gave it the name because it has many of the same characteristics as the lunch meat Spam: [PAR] Nobody wants it or ever asks for it. [PAR] No one ever eats it; it is the first item to be pushed to the side when eating the entree. [PAR] Sometimes it is actually tasty, like 1% of junk mail that is really useful to some people. [PAR] The term spam can also be used to describe any \"unwanted\" email from a company or website -- typically at some point a user would have agreed to receive the email via subscription list opt-in -- a newer term called graymail is used to describe this particular type of spam. [PAR] Why Spam is a Problem [PAR] In addition to wasting people's time with unwanted email, spam also eats up a lot of network bandwidth . Consequently, there are many organizations, as well as individuals, who have taken it upon themselves to fight spam with a variety of techniques. But because the Internet is public, there is really little that can be done to prevent spam, just as it is impossible to prevent junk mail. However, some online services have instituted policies to prevent spammers from spamming their subscribers.

The story is set in Clayton County, Georgia, and Atlanta during the American Civil War and Reconstruction era. It depicts the experiences of Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner, who must use every means at her disposal to come out of the poverty she finds herself in after Sherman's March to the Sea. A historical novel, the story is a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, with the title taken from a poem written by Ernest Dowson. [PAR] Gone with the Wind was popular with American readers from the onset and was the top American fiction bestseller in the year it was published and in 1937. As of 2014, a Harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of American readers, just behind the Bible. More than 30 million copies have been printed worldwide. [PAR] Written from the perspective of the slaveholder, Gone with the Wind is Southern plantation fiction. Its portrayal of slavery and African Americans is controversial, as well as its use of a racial epithet and ethnic slurs. However, the novel has become a reference point for subsequent writers about the South, both black and white. Scholars at American universities refer to it in their writings, interpret and study it. The novel has been absorbed into American popular culture. [PAR] Margaret Mitchell was imaginative in the use of color symbolism, especially the colors red and green, which surround Scarlett O'Hara. Mitchell identified the primary theme as survival. She left the ending speculative for the reader, however. She was often asked what became of her lovers, Rhett and Scarlett. She did not know, and said, \"For all I know, Rhett may have found someone else who was less difficult.\" Two sequels authorized by Mitchell's estate were published more than a half century later. A parody was also produced. [PAR] Mitchell received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for the book in 1937. It was adapted into a 1939 American film. The book is often read or misread through the film. Gone with the Wind is the only novel by Mitchell published during her lifetime.

Her mother, Mary Wright Sewell, was a successful children's book author. Sewell was mostly educated at home and did not attend school for the first time until she was twelve years old. Two years later, she seriously injured both ankles in an accident. From then on, Sewell had extremely limited mobility; she required crutches and could never walk great distances.\u00a0 [PAR] Sewell resorted to using horse-drawn carriages for transportation. Soon she fell in love with horses and became deeply concerned about their humane treatment. That concern led her to undertake the children's [PAR] classic\u00a0Black Beauty. Sewell undertook the novel not for children, but for those who cared for horses. She said her \"special aim [was] to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding\" toward equines. But when Sewell began the novel in 1871, her health was already failing. At first, she narrated the story to her mother. In 1876, Sewell began writing on small slips of paper, which her mother would then transcribe.\u00a0 [PAR] Sewell completed\u00a0Black Beauty in 1877, only five months before she passed away.

            "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Gresham's lawIn economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that \"bad money drives out good\". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.    [PAR] The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519\u20131579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors. The law had been stated earlier by Nicolaus Copernicus; for this reason, it is occasionally known as the Copernicus Law.   It was also stated in the 14th\u00a0century, by Nicole Oresme c.1350,  in his treatise On the Origin, Nature, Law, and Alterations of Money,   and by jurist and historian Al-Maqrizi (1364\u20131442) in the Mamluk Empire; and noted by Aristophanes in his play The Frogs, which dates from around the end of the 5th\u00a0century BC. [PAR] Good money and bad money [PAR] Good money is money that shows little difference between its nominal value (the face value of the coin) and its commodity value (the value of the metal of which it is made, often precious metals, nickel, or copper). [PAR] In the absence of legal-tender laws, metal coin money will freely exchange at somewhat above bullion market value. This may be observed in bullion coins such as the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf, the South African Krugerrand, the American Gold Eagle, or even the silver Maria Theresa thaler (Austria). Coins of this type are of a known purity and are in a convenient form to handle. People prefer trading in coins rather than in anonymous hunks of precious metal, so they attribute more value to the coins of equal weight. [PAR] The price spread between face value and commodity value is called seigniorage.  Because some coins do not circulate, remaining in the possession of coin collectors, this can increase demand for coinage. [PAR] On the other hand, bad money is money that has a commodity value considerably lower than its face value and is in circulation along with good money, where both forms are required to be accepted at equal value as legal tender. [PAR] In Gresham's day, bad money included any coin that had been debased. Debasement was often done by the issuing body, where less than the officially specified amount of precious metal was contained in an issue of coinage, usually by alloying it with a base metal.  The public could also debase coins, usually by clipping or scraping off small portions of the precious metal, also known as \"stemming\" (reeded edges on coins were intended to make clipping evident). Other examples of bad money include counterfeit coins made from base metal. Today all circulating coins are made from base metals, known as fiat money. [PAR] In the case of clipped, scraped, or counterfeit coins, the commodity value was reduced by fraud, as the face value remains at the previous higher level. On the other hand, with a coinage debased by a government issuer, the commodity value of the coinage was often reduced quite openly, while the face value of the debased coins was held at the higher level by legal tender laws. [PAR] Examples  [PAR] Silver coins were widely circulated in Canada (until 1968) and in the United States (until 1964 for dimes and quarters and 1970 for half-dollars) when the Coinage Act of 1965 was passed. These countries debased their coins by switching to cheaper metals thereby inflating the new debased currency in relation to the supply of the former silver coins. The silver coins disappeared from circulation as citizens retained them to capture the steady current and future intrinsic value of the metal content over the newly inflated and therefore devalued coins, using the newer coins in daily transactions. In the late 1970s, the Hunt brothers attempted to corner the worldwide silver market but failed, temporarily driving the price far above its historic levels and intensifying the extraction of silver coins from circulation. [PAR] The same process occurs today with the copper content of coins such as the pre-1997 Canadian penny, the pre-1982 United States penny and the",

He was born at       Pembroke Castle when his mother was only thirteen. His father had died       just three months earlier. He was presented to his father\ufffds maternal       half-brother, King Henry VI , during the brief       Lancastrian Restoration of 1470-1 but, after the return of Edward       IV in the latter year, had to seek asylum in Brittany. Both Edward IV       and Richard III made attempts to induce the       Duke of Brittany to surrender his guest and one of these was very nearly       successful. When the Duke of Buckingham rose against Richard III, Henry       was already off the English coast preparing to join him, but was unable to       land. After this failure, Henry repaired to France, where English exiles       gathered round him in 1484-5. On 1st August of the latter year, he sailed       from Harfleur with about 2,000 men, landed in Wales and defeated and slew       Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth, three weeks later. [PAR] Henry was well received in       London as King Henry VII and was crowned in October 1485. Parliament       entailed the Crown on him and the heirs of his body. He had, however,       solemnly sworn in France to marry the Princess Elizabeth, now the       undoubted heiress of the Yorkist claims, and thus to unite the two rival       houses. The marriage took place at the beginning of 1486, but Henry was       always careful to maintain that his title to the Crown was independent of       his wife's. Two successive pretenders to the throne, each claiming to       represent a Plantagenet prince, were easily disposed of \ufffd Lambert Simnel       at the Battle of Stoke, in 1487, and Perkin Warbeck, who gave more       trouble, by adroit diplomacy with the various European Courts which had       successively given him shelter, in 1497.

He presided over the \u201cBloody Assizes\u201d of 1685 following the failure of the duke of Monmouth\u2019s rebellion and was in charge of executing the unpopular religious policy of the Roman Catholic king James II . [PAR] George Jeffreys, detail of an oil painting attributed to H. Claret; in the National Portrait \u2026 [PAR] Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery, London [PAR] Born into the Welsh gentry, Jeffreys was admitted to the bar in 1668, and in 1677 he obtained an appointment as solicitor general to Charles II\u2019s Roman Catholic brother James, duke of York (later James II). During the panic that followed Titus Oates\u2019s fabricated revelations (1678) of a popish plot against the government, Jeffreys served as a prosecuting counsel or judge in many of the trials of suspected Catholic conspirators. He earned notoriety by savagely ridiculing and bullying the defendants. [PAR] Despite his Protestantism and his role as a prosecutor of Catholics, Jeffreys became increasingly prominent in the court party of Charles and James. In 1680 he fought against the Exclusion Bill, which would have prevented James from succeeding to the throne, and in 1683 he became lord chief justice . Meanwhile, he served as prosecutor and judge, respectively, in the treason trials of Lord William Russell and Algernon Sidney . Although the evidence against these two Whig defendants was flimsy, Jeffreys had them convicted and executed. He sentenced Titus Oates to a severe flogging and imprisonment in May 1685, and in the same month James II made him Baron Jeffreys of Wem. [PAR] During the \u201cBloody Assizes\u201d that followed the collapse (July 1685) of the insurrection of James Scott, duke of Monmouth, Jeffreys prosecuted the rebels with ferocity, executing perhaps 150 to 200 persons and ordering hundreds of others sold into slavery in the colonies. At the same time, he profited by extorting money from the victims. Nevertheless, James II made him lord chancellor in September 1685. As one of the most influential royal advisers, Jeffreys took charge of the ecclesiastical commission that forced the Church of England to accept James\u2019s pro-Catholic policies. When William of Orange , stadholder of Holland (later King William III), overthrew James\u2019s government in December 1688, Jeffreys tried to escape from the country disguised as a sailor, but he was arrested and died four months later in the Tower of London .

In the 1950s, workers on oil rigs in the Persian Gulf would work incredibly long and dangerous hours. So, of course they relieved the tedium with alcohol. Apparently, a few of them, some sources say a mix of Turks, Serbs, Albanians, American engineers, and maybe a Greek or two, poured orange juice and vodka into cans while working on the rigs. The name came from the workers using a screwdriver to stir their secret alcoholic elixir. [PAR] Outside the US, it is often referred to as \u201cvodka and orange\u201d, but no matter where you order it, the two base ingredients are the same. Variations include: the \u201cPoor Man\u2019s Screwdriver\u201d (substitute Sunny D for orange juice); the \u201cTang Banger\u201d (use TANG); the \u201cBrass Monkey\u201d (a traditional Screwdriver with dark rum added); and the popular \u201cHarvey Wallbanger\u201d (splash some Galliano on top).

[PAR] In Pennsylvania in the 19th century, Tom Collins was the name given to a fictional bogeyman who gossiped about locals. Patrons in pubs and restaurants would sprinkle their conversation with \u201cHave you seen Tom Collins?\u201d And, eventually, to be \u201cknown by Tom Collins\u201d was to imply that someone was talking about that person. Newspapers ran hoax stories claiming to be about the real Tom Collins, who invariably was in trouble of some sort. It became so popular that \u201cTom Collins folk songs\u201d were written and performed on stages all over the east coast. By the mid-1870s Tom Collins had a secure place in American folk lore.

Thirty years later, two of the remaining kinds of currency would also disappear, leaving only one.

[PAR] Federal Reserve Notes (Series 1950: $5 $10 $20 $50 $100) Go! [PAR] And all that remained by 1970 were: [PAR] Federal Reserve Notes (Series 1969: $1 $5 $10 $20 $50 $100 -- Series 1976: $2) Go! [PAR] . [PAR] The origin and nature of these kinds of currency will be considered below.  Although the color of the seals and serial numbers on Gold Certificates was yellow, here orange is used for greater contrast.  The reverse of large note Gold Certificates had actually been orange, \"goldbacks\" as opposed to \"greenbacks\"; but small note Gold Certificates were made \"greenbacks\" also.  (That was reversed with series 1934 Gold Certificates, which again had orange reverses, but those notes never circulated to the public). [PAR] That was part of a process to unify the design of all the currency.  The variety of large note design gave way to common elements and a common look for the small notes.  This changed little over the years, until a radically redesigned $100 bill was introduced in the 1990's, inaugurating a gradual change in all the currency for security reasons.  United States currency had never featured anti-counterfeiting devices like watermarked paper and security threads, which had appeared in foreign money decades earlier. [PAR] All the small notes featured a portrait of Washington for the $1 note, Jefferson for $2, Lincoln for $5, Hamilton for $10, Jackson for $20, Grant for $50, Franklin for $100, McKinley for $500, Cleveland for $1000, Madison for $5000, and Chase for the $10,000.  When one series of $100,000 notes was issued (1934 Gold Certificates), Wilson was put on them.  Although these portraits are often called \"dead presidents,\" three of them, Hamilton, Franklin, and Chase, were never Presidents.  Large notes had featured many more portraits, including Martha Washington, William Tecumseh Sherman, John Marshall, James Monroe, the Sioux Indian Takokainyanka, Samuel F.B. Morse,",
